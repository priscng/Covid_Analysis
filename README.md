# Covid Data Analysis


## Objective
The objective of this project is to extract covid data, transform the data using Postgres SQL and load the data into Tableau for visualization. This project is inspired while viewing the Alex the Analyst youtube channel, [Data Analyst Portfolio Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f).

In this project, I've also explored building an ETL pipeline using PySpark.


## Dataset
The dataset is extracted from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).


## Tools Adopted
- PostgresSQL 14
- PySpark
- Tableau 2022.2
